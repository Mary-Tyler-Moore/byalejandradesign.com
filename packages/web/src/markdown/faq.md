1. Why is my item different from the photo?

   - These are handcrafted items. Subtle differences should be embraced and are a part of the handcrafting process!

2. How do I care for my piece?

   - All ceramics are fragile by nature so need to be handled with care. A gentle knock of your piece on the sink while hand-washing or your piece being bumped against another dish in the dishwasher can initiate a hairline crack.
   - Ceramics are also sensitive to thermal shock so please avoid heating or cooling your ceramics too quickly, eg, pouring hot water in a mug washed in cold water.
