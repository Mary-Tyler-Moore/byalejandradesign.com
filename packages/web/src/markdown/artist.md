I am a self-taught artist and I have learned multiple mediums and techniques out of curiosity and practice. My workflow focuses on the iterative process of making and failing. I am interested in creating patterns and textures in the work I do.

I grew up in an artistic environment and was exposed at an early age to artisan work. While growing up I also spent time at construction sites with my dad and somehow the combination of it all led me to study architecture. I moved to London to study a masterâ€™s in computational design and robotic fabrication. Within those seven years of study I lived in different cities and I became fascinated with patterns, materials and textures.

I am interested in bridging the gap between digital design and craftmanship. How does one inform the other? How does the process enrich the making? How does the making and the iteration process create variations and unique pieces? And lastly, how do these pieces create new ideas for design? The work is the iteration of making.

This work is a series of ceramics that focus on how the density of patterns change the perception of form. The making of the pieces is a long process that combines digital design and old-world craftmanship.
The form and complexity of the patterns that are created require a delicate hand carving process as well as slip casting, mold making, 3d printing, and computer modeling. The end result is a breathtaking combination of digital precision and real world interaction. The final step of glazing the pieces complements the patterns and results in natural behavior that is impossible to replicate. It is the combination of these two types of creation that make these pieces so interesting.

The 4-12 is a very bold pattern with striking edges. The colors in this vase bleed from purple tones into a white. The bleed in between creates another tone of purple. This vase looks great with other vases to create a beautiful combination.
