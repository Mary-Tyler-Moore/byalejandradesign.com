Iâ€™m a designer based in NYC with a background in architecture and computational design. I have always been curious to learn new techniques and materials. For a few years I have been getting my hands dirty making pottery while creating different geometries digitally. Not so long ago I started researching for a way to merge both. And so, with the help of a 3D printer I have been bringing these designs to life!
