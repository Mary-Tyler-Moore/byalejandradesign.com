##### Returns

All sales are final. Since these are handcrafted speciality items we unfortunately cannot offer you a refund.

##### Exchanges

We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at alejandra@byalejandradesign.com and send your item to: 1678 1st Ave. Apt. 2N, New York, NY, 10128, United States.

##### Shipping

You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for exchanging your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.

Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary.

If you are shipping an item over \$75, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We donâ€™t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
