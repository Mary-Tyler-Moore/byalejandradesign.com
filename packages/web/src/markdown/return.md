##### Returns

All sales are final. Since these are handcrafted speciality items we unfortunately cannot offer you a refund. We do not accept returns for change of mind or ceramics damaged after use. Once your ceramic is unwrapped and in use, we are not responsible for any cracks that may appear.

##### Exchanges

All ceramics are checked to be in good order before we carefully package and send your items. We do accept returns on items that have been damaged during shipping. If your item arrives to you damaged please contact us within 48 hours with photographs of the damage and the outer box (we need these to claim delivery insurance). If we can replace it with something you are happy with, we will. Otherwise we will refund your purchase and postage in full.
