              By Alejandra Design focuses on creating intricate design products
              for both home d√©cor and wearable art. The products are designed
              using computational algorithms and printed in-house with our 3D
              printer. The final pieces are made using slipcasting technique and
              fired in a kiln. Each piece is then hand glazed to create varying
              effects and ends up with different patterns and beautiful
              geometric results!

              Alejandra is an architect with a great curiosity in both
              computational design and fabrication. Her architectural studies
              led her to live in multiple cities, but she ultimately settled in
              her favorite one: NYC. Shortly after moving, she started taking
              sculpture and ceramic classes while developing new scripted
              geometries. After quite a lot of experimentation, she found a
              workflow to bring her intricate designs to life and started By
              Alejandra Design.

              Collections are products curated based on technique, color and/or
              material. Items in a collection are made to be combined easily
              with one another but feel free to mix and match if it suits your
              taste!
