            Iâ€™m a designer based in NYC with a background in architecture and
            computational design. I have always been curious to learn new
            techniques and materials. For a few years I have been getting my
            hands dirty making pottery while creating different geometries
            digitally. Not so long ago I started researching for a way to merge
            both. And so, with the help of a 3D printer I have been bringing
            these designs to life!
