            By Alejandra Design focuses on creating intricate design products
            for both home d√©cor and wearable art. The products are designed
            using computational algorithms and printed in-house with our 3D
            printer. The final pieces are made using slipcasting technique and
            fired in a kiln. Each piece is then hand glazed to create varying
            effects and ends up with different patterns and beautiful geometric
            results!

          <p className="body-sourceSans-1">
            Alejandra is an architect with a great curiosity in both
            computational design and fabrication. Her architectural studies led
            her to live in multiple cities, but she ultimately settled in her
            favorite one: NYC. Shortly after moving, she started taking
            sculpture and ceramic classes while developing new scripted
            geometries. After quite a lot of experimentation, she found a
            workflow to bring her intricate designs to life and started By
            Alejandra Design.
